## 💡 About the Project

DCL-350 focuses on implementing a microservice architecture. It uses Spring Cloud to make setting up and managing these services simpler. In this project, you’ll learn about key concepts like:

- **CQRS Pattern**
- **Domain-Driven Design**
- **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Hexagonal Architecture**
- **Resilience4j**
- **Spring Cloud Config**
- **Spring Cloud Eureka**
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**

This application is perfect for anyone looking to explore modern software development techniques.

## ⚙️ Features

The DCL-350 application includes several features that enhance your understanding of microservice architecture:

- **Service Discovery with Eureka:** Automatically detects services in your system.
- **Config Server:** Centralizes external configuration for your applications.
- **API Gateway:** Manages traffic and acts as a single-entry point for your services.
- **Resilience Features:** Provides tools to handle failures gracefully.

## 🔍 Exploring the Project

Once you have the application running, you can explore different components. Here’s how to find specific features:

### 🌐 Service Discovery

Check out how services register and communicate with one another using Eureka. This feature makes your system robust and scalable.

### 🔑 Configuration Management

Learn to manage application properties through the Config Server. You can update settings without restarting your services.

### 🚀 Traffic Management

The API Gateway lets you direct requests efficiently. Understand how it manages requests to enhance performance.

## 📖 Documentation

We provide a comprehensive user guide. It contains step-by-step instructions for using all features.
